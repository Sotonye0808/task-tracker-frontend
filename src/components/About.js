        <h3>Track Your Tasks</h3> 
        
        <p>This is a very crude version of this application. Unusual behaviour may be observed and design is rather lazy. A much updated version is to be released soon!</p>

        
        <p>This is a simple task tracker app built using React. It allows users to track their tasks by adding, deleting, and marking tasks as complete.</p>
        
        <h4>Features</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Add new tasks: Users can add tasks by entering a task name and optionally specifying a day and time.</li>
            <li>Delete tasks: Users can remove tasks from the list.</li>
            <li>Toggle reminder: Users can toggle a reminder for a task, which will display a reminder notification.
          </li>
          <li>Responsive design: The app is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.</li>
          <li>Local storage: Task data is stored locally in the browser, so tasks persist even after refreshing the page.</li>
          
        </ul>
